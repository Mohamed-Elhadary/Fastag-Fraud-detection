# Fastag-Fraud-detection
An effective and scalable Fastag fraud detection system capable of minimizing financial losses and ensuring the security of digital toll transactions.

Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning classification techniques to develop an effective fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. The dataset includes key features such as transaction details, vehicle information, geographical location, and transaction amounts. The goal is to create a robust model that accurately identifies instances of fraudulent activity, ensuring the integrity and security of Fastag transactions.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction
Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction
Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved in the transaction
FastagID: Unique identifier for Fastag
TollBoothID: Identifier for the toll booth
Lane_Type: Type of lane used for the transaction
Vehicle_Dimensions: Dimensions of the vehicle
Transaction_Amount: Amount associated with the transaction
Amount_paid: Amount paid for the transaction
Geographical_Location: Location details of the transaction
Vehicle_Speed: Speed of the vehicle during the transaction
Vehicle_Plate_Number: License plate number of the vehicle
Fraud_indicator: Binary indicator of fraudulent activity (target variable)
